The challenge was to create a javascript code to generate a random password.

## User Story

I first started out by setting up an outline to follow.
I then added variables for which to referance to.
Following the referance I set up the function and prompts for the generator.
Afterwards I validated all the inputs.
I used several console logs as I moved forward to ensure proper working order.
I tested the html page several times until the password generated and the code was complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
